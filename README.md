#  AI-Based Productivity Prediction for Garment Workers

## 📖 Project Overview
This project applies **predictive analytics and machine learning techniques** to analyze and predict the **productivity of garment workers** using historical production data.

The goal is to understand key factors affecting productivity and to build a reliable predictive model that can estimate worker productivity for unknown data.

---

##  Objectives
- Perform descriptive and statistical analysis on garment worker productivity data  
- Clean and preprocess real-world industrial data  
- Apply feature selection techniques  
- Build and compare multiple predictive models  
- Select and save the best-performing model  
- Use the trained model to predict productivity on unseen data
