 AI-Based Productivity Prediction for Garment Workers
 Project Overview
This project applies predictive analytics and machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the productivity of garment workers using historical production data. The goal is to understand key factors affecting productivity and to build a reliable predictive model that can estimate worker productivity for unknown data.
The project follows a complete data analytics pipeline, including data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
 Objectives
Perform descriptive and statistical analysis on garment worker productivity data
Clean and preprocess real-world industrial data
Apply feature selection techniques
Build and compare multiple predictive models
Select and save the best-performing model
Use the trained model to predict productivity on unseen data
